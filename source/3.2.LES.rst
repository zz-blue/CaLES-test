3.2.1. Wall-resolved turbulent plane channel flow
-----------------------------------------------------

This case corresponds to ``example/les/_manuscript_turbulent_channel``. 

This example simulates a fully developed turbulent plane channel flow using WRLES. The simulation employs two subgrid-scale models: the classical Smagorinsky model and the dynamic Smagorinsky model.

- **Domain size**: `(Lx, Ly, Lz) = (12.8h, 2.0h, 4.8h)`, where `h` is the channel half-height.
- **Boundary conditions**: No-slip boundary condition in the y-direction and periodic boundary conditions in the `x` and `z` directions.
- **Reynolds number**: `Reτ = 20,000`, with a friction coefficient `Cf = 0.00591`.
- **Grid resolution**: Four different grids are used for a grid convergence study, with the wall-normal grid spacing varying from approximately `40+` to `10+`, maintaining an aspect ratio `AR = ∆x/∆z = 1.8`.

3.2.2. Wall-modeled turbulent plane channel flow
-----------------------------------------------------

This case corresponds to ``example/les/_manuscript_turbulent_channel_wall_model``. 

This example simulates a fully developed turbulent plane channel flow using WMLES. The simulation employs two subgrid-scale models: the classical Smagorinsky model and the dynamic Smagorinsky model.

- **Domain size and boundary conditions**: The domain size and boundary conditions are the same as those used in the WRLES case.
- **Reynolds number**: `Reτ = 250,000`, with a friction coefficient `Cf = 0.00344`.
- **Grid resolution**: Thirteen different grids are used for a grid convergence study, with the wall-normal grid spacing varying from approximately `0.1h` to `0.006h`. The aspect ratio is `AR = 1.0` and `2.0`.
- **Wall-modeling layer thickness**: The wall-modeling layer thickness is set to `hwm = 0.1h`.

3.2.3. Wall-modeled turbulent square duct flow
-------------------------------------------------

This case corresponds to ``example/les/_manuscript_turbulent_duct_wall_model``. 

This example simulates a fully developed turbulent flow in a square duct using WMLES. The simulation employs two subgrid-scale models: the classical Smagorinsky model and the dynamic Smagorinsky model.

- **Domain size**: `(Lx, Ly, Lz) = (12.8h, 2.0h, 2.0h)`, where `h` is half the side length of the duct.
- **Boundary conditions**: Wall-modeled boundary conditions are applied in the `y` and `z` directions, with periodic boundary conditions in the `x` direction.
- **Reynolds number**: `Reτ = 40,000`, with a friction coefficient `Cf = 0.00557`.
- **Grid resolution**: Six different grids are used for a grid convergence study, with the wall-normal grid spacing varying from approximately `0.1h` to `0.006h`.
- **Wall-modeling layer thickness**: The wall-modeling layer thickness is set to `hwm = 0.1h`.
