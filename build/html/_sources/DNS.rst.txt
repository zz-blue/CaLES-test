Lid-driven cavity flow
---------------------------------------

This case corresponds to ``example/dns/_manuscript_lid_driven_cavity``. 

This example simulates a lid-driven cavity flow in a cubic domain, where the top wall moves with a constant velocity while the other walls are stationary with no-slip boundary conditions.

- **Domain:** A cubic domain with dimensions `[-h/2, h/2]^3`.
- **Boundary Conditions:** 

  - No-slip and no-penetration conditions on all walls except the top. 

  - The top wall moves with a velocity `u(x, y, h/2) = (U, 0, 0)`.  

- **Reynolds Number:** Defined as `Re = Uh/ν = 1000`.  

The following figure shows the profiles of the steady-state solution at the centerlines:

Pressure-driven turbulent channel and square duct flow
------------------------------------------------------------

These cases correspond to ``example/dns/_manuscript_turbulent_channel`` and ``example/dns/_manuscript_turbulent_duct``. 

This example considers two turbulent wall-bounded flows: a plane channel and a square duct. Both flows are driven by pressure and share similar boundary conditions and physical parameters.

- **Boundary conditions**: 

  - Both flows are periodic in the streamwise (x) direction.

  - No-slip/no-penetration boundary conditions are applied at the wall-normal directions:

    - For the square duct, at `y = ±h` and `z = ±h`.

    - For the plane channel, at `z = ±h`, with periodicity in the spanwise direction `y`.
- **Volume force**: A volume force is added to the discretized momentum equation to maintain a bulk streamwise velocity `Ub = 1`.
- **Reynolds number**: The Reynolds number is defined as `Re = Ub(2h)/ν`, with `h` being the channel or duct half-height

  - For the square duct, `Re = 4410`.

  - For the plane channel, `Re = 5640`.

Taylor–Green vortex
---------------------------------------

This case corresponds to ``example/dns/_manuscript_taylor_green_vortex``. 

The Taylor–Green vortex is solved in a tri-periodic domain with dimensions `[0, 2π]³`. The initial velocity field is defined as:

- **Initial velocity field**:

  -  u0 = U \sin(x/L) \cos(y/L) \cos(z/L) 

  -  v0 = -U \cos(x/L) \sin(y/L) \cos(z/L) 

  -  w0 = 0 
- **Reynolds number**: The Reynolds number is defined as `Re = 1600`
